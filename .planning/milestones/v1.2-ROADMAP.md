# Milestone v1.2: Autoplay Stability & Polish

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-05
**Phases:** 1-3
**Total Plans:** 6

## Overview

This milestone fixes the broken autoplay orchestration chain so the automated generate-evaluate-refine loop actually works. The core issue is that state transitions happen but API calls never fire. We'll fix orchestration first, then wire up accurate UI state and locking, then polish the Activity Modal visuals and document the architecture.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Orchestration Fix
**Goal**: Autoplay generates images without manual intervention
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: ORCH-01, ORCH-02, ORCH-03, ORCH-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Starting autoplay triggers image generation within 5 seconds
  2. A single iteration completes generate, evaluate, and refine steps without stalling
  3. Multi-phase mode progresses through all configured phases automatically
  4. No timeout errors appear during normal autoplay operation
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Fix single-phase orchestration with callback-based prompt propagation
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Wire multi-phase to delegate to single-phase orchestrator

### Phase 2: UI State & Lock
**Goal**: User sees accurate progress and cannot interfere with running autoplay
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: STATE-01, STATE-02, STATE-03, LOCK-01, LOCK-02, LOCK-03, LOCK-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Generate button label reflects current operation (idle/generating/evaluating/refining)
  2. Activity Modal shows real-time progress updates as operations complete
  3. Iteration counter increments each time a cycle completes
  4. Dimension inputs, manual generate button, and Smart Breakdown are disabled during autoplay
  5. Abort button remains clickable and stops autoplay immediately
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Wire autoplay status to generate button label and iteration counter
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Lock dimension inputs and SmartBreakdown during autoplay

### Phase 3: Polish & Documentation
**Goal**: Activity Modal matches main page visual quality and architecture is documented
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: ARCH-01, ARCH-02, ARCH-03, UI-01, UI-02, UI-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Activity Modal typography (fonts, sizes, weights) matches main page
  2. Activity Modal spacing and layout follows main page patterns
  3. Activity Modal color scheme is consistent with app theme (slate backgrounds, cyan/purple accents)
  4. Orchestrator effect chain is documented with data flow diagram
  5. PATTERNS.md includes lessons learned from this milestone
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Update PATTERNS.md with orchestrator data flow diagram and lessons learned
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Polish Activity Modal typography, spacing, and colors to match main page

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Use callback pattern instead of effect-based state watching to avoid async timing issues
- Multi-phase delegates to single-phase for generate->evaluate->refine loop
- 120s timeout for both single-phase and multi-phase as safety nets
- Status labels derived via callback function rather than inline conditionals
- Thread disabled prop through component hierarchy rather than using context
- Use ASCII diagrams instead of Mermaid for simpler tooling requirements
- type-label token (11px) for smallest text ensures WCAG AA compliance

**Issues Resolved:**
- Fixed: Orchestrator state transitions but API calls don't fire
- Fixed: Multi-phase autoplay needs same fix as single-phase
- Fixed: Modal stays open but "sketch" phase times out after 2 minutes
- Fixed: Abort flow missing singlePhaseOrchestrator.abortAutoplay() call

**Issues Deferred:**
- Iteration counter uses progress.saved as proxy (true iteration tracking deferred)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None significant - all core functionality complete

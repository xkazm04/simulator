## How to Use These Ideas

1. **Start with a screenshot** from the original game as your base image
2. **Let AI describe** the visual format (camera angle, UI layout, composition)
3. **Fill in dimensions** with the mashup content suggested above
4. **Generate prompts** that preserve the format but swap the content

Remember: The goal is to create images that still "feel" like the original game's visual format, just with entirely different content within that frame.
